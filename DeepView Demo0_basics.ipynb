    " 1. Create a wrapper funktion like ```pred_wrapper``` which receives a numpy array of samples and returns according class probabilities from the classifier as numpy arrays\n",
    " 2. Initialize DeepView-object and pass the created method to the constructor\n",
    " 3. Run your code and call ```add_samples(samples, labels)``` at any time to add samples to the visualization together with the ground truth labels.\n",
    "    * The ground truth labels will be visualized along with the predicted labels\n",
    "    * The object will keep track of a maximum number of samples specified by ```max_samples``` and it will throw away the oldest samples first\n",
